                    <Heading scale='xl' my="24px">10. RISKS</Heading>

                    <Text>

                        10.1. By utilizing the Services or interacting with the Site in any way, you represent and warrant that you understand the inherent risks associated with cryptographic systems and blockchain-based networks (including, without limitation, sudden changes in operating rules, such as those commonly referred to as “forks,” and advances in code cracking or other technical advancements, such as the development of quantum computers, which may materially affect the Services); Digital Assets, including the usage and intricacies of native Digital Assets, like ether (ETH); smart contract-based tokens, such as those that follow the Ethereum Token Standard; and systems that interact with blockchain-based networks. NSAVDEX.IO does not own or control any of the underlying software through which blockchain networks are formed. In general, the software underlying blockchain networks, including the Ethereum and NSAVDEX.io (BSC) Blockchain, is open source, such that anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute it.<br />

                        10.2. The Services and your Digital Assets could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory actions, which may require us to, upon request by government agencies, take certain actions or provide information, which may not be in your best interest or could impede or limit the ability of NSAVDEX.IO to continue to make available its proprietary software and, thus, could impede or limit your ability to access or use the Services.<br />

                        10.3. You understand that the Ethereum blockchain remains under development, which creates technological and security risks when using the Services in addition to uncertainty relating to Digital Assets and transactions therein. You acknowledge that the cost of transacting on the Ethereum blockchain is variable and may increase at any time causing impact to any activities taking place on the Ethereum blockchain, which may result in price fluctuations or increased costs when using the Services.<br />

                        10.4. Although we intend to provide accurate and timely information on the Site and during your use of the Services, the Site and other information available when using the Services may not always be entirely accurate, complete, or current and may also include technical inaccuracies or typographical errors. To continue to provide you with as complete and accurate information as possible, information may be changed or updated from time to time without notice, including, without limitation, information regarding our policies. Accordingly, you should verify all information before relying on it, and all decisions based on information contained on the Site or as part of the Services are your sole responsibility. No representation is made as to the accuracy, completeness, or appropriateness for any particular purpose of any pricing information distributed via the Site or otherwise when using the Services. Prices and pricing information may be higher or lower than prices available on platforms providing similar services.<br />

                        10.5. Any use or interaction with the Services requires a comprehensive understanding of applied cryptography and computer science to appreciate the inherent risks, including those listed above. You represent and warrant that you possess relevant knowledge and skills. Any reference to a type of Digital Asset on the Site or otherwise during the use of the Services does not indicate our approval or disapproval of the technology on which the Digital Asset relies, and should not be used as a substitute for your understanding of the risks specific to each type of Digital Asset.<br />

                        10.6. Use of the Services, including, without limitation, for trading Digital Assets, borrowing or supplying Digital Assets, trading on margin, and entering into derivatives and swaps contracts, may carry financial risk. Digital Assets, especially in connection with derivatives and swaps contracts are, by their nature, highly experimental, risky, and volatile. Transactions entered into in connection with the Services are irreversible and final and there are no refunds. You acknowledge and agree that you will access and use the Site and the Services at your own risk. The risk of loss in trading Digital Assets, especially when trading on margin, can be substantial. You should, therefore, carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for you in light of your circumstances and financial resources. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you have been, are, and will be solely responsible for making your independent appraisal and investigations into the risks of a given transaction and the underlying Digital Assets, including any margin. You represent that you have sufficient knowledge, market sophistication, professional advice, and experience to make your evaluation of the merits and risks of any transaction conducted in connection with the Services or any Digital Asset.

                    <Text>
                        12.1. NSAVDEX.IO develops a non-custodial software interface to post orders on NSAVDEX,io (BSC) Blockchain Protocol, which is a decentralized peer-to-peer protocol that people can use to enter into decentralized perpetual swaps, futures, spot trades and trade on margin. The protocol is made up of free, public, open-source or source-available software including a set of smart contracts that are deployed on various blockchain networks, including, without limitation, the Ethereum and NSAVDEX.io (BSC) blockchains. Your use of the NSAVDEX.IO relayer and NSAVDEX.io (BSC) protocol involves various risks, including, but not limited to, risks inherent to cryptographic systems and blockchain-based networks, and losses due to the fluctuation of prices of tokens and other assets underlying derivatives contracts and swaps. Before using the NSAVDEX.IO, you should review the relevant documentation to make sure you understand how the NSAVDEX.io (BSC) protocol works. Additionally, just as you can access email protocols such as SMTP through multiple email clients, you can access the NSAVDEX.io (BSC) protocol through a variety of web or mobile interfaces, NSAVDEX.IO being one of them. You are responsible for doing your own diligence on NSAVDEX.IO to understand the fees and risks present.  No developer or entity involved in creating the NSAVDEX.IO interface will be liable for any claims or damages whatsoever associated with your use, inability to use, or your interaction with other users of, the NSAVDEX.io (BSC) protocol, including any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages, or loss of profits, cryptocurrencies, tokens, or anything else of value.<br />

                        12.2. NSAVDEX.IO does not operate a Digital Asset or derivatives exchange platform nor offer brokerage, legal, advisory, custody, trade execution nor clearing services and, therefore, has no oversight, involvement, or control concerning your transactions using the Services. All transactions between users of NSAVDEX.IO-developed software are executed peer-to-peer directly between the users’ Ethereum addresses through a smart contract.
                        <br />
                        12.3. You understand that NSAVDEX.IO is not registered or licensed by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US Securities and Exchange Commission, or any financial regulatory authority. No financial regulatory authority has reviewed or approved the use of the NSAVDEX.IO-developed software. The Site and the NSAVDEX.IO-developed software do not constitute advice or a recommendation concerning any commodity, security, or other Digital Asset or instrument. NSAVDEX.IO is not acting as an investment adviser or commodity trading adviser to any person or entity.
                        <br />
                        12.4. NSAVDEX.IO does not own or control the underlying software protocols that are used in connection with margin positions or derivatives or swap contracts. In general, the underlying protocols are open source and anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute them. NSAVDEX.IO is not responsible for the operation of the underlying protocols, and NSAVDEX.IO makes no guarantee of their functionality, security, or availability.
                        <br />
